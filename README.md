## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Node.js: this project requires installation of Node.js 18.17 or later. [Next Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/getting-started/installation)

Ethereum Sepolia: The Hypercert Marketplace is currently deployed on Sepolia Testnet. To interact with Voicedeck's impact Hypercerts, you'll need to connect to Sepolia Testnet and obtain SepoliaETH from a [testnet token faucet](https://faucetlink.to/sepolia).

### Network Configuration

| Parameter                     | Value                                     |

- [Hypercerts Documentation](https://hypercerts.org/docs/) Hypercerts create this interoperability by serving as a single, open, shared, decentralized database for impact funding mechanisms. A single hypercert is a semi-fungible token that accounts for work that is supposed to be impactful and whose ownership is fractionizable and transferable (under specific conditions). Hypercerts do not impose any specific funding mechanisms but provide baseline invariant guarantees such that claims will not be forgotten as different mechanisms come into and out of fashion. This is also why hypercerts are especially useful for any retrospective funding mechanisms â€“ funding can be applied to claims of the past.
